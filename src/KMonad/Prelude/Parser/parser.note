So it's questionable whether parser should live in Prelude or App.

I've decided to go for both, because:

1. There are some parsing primitives that I intend to reuse for future projects
and are not bound to _kmonad in any way, those live in Prelude.

2. There are some very _kmonad specific parsers, those live in App.
